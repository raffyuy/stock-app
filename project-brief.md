# Coding Exercise

Welcome to Maia Technology/Atlas Carbon's coding exercise for prospective Software Engineers.

## The Exercise

Build the backend API for this app that satisfies the requirements in the [feature-file](./feature-file.md). Please read the through the feature file carefully. Elaborate and make notes in the file if there are unclear requirements. Add design decisions and any assumptions you make while building.

The app's frontend UI is already included in the [ui folder](./ui/) See the ui app for the expected data structure.

## What we'll look for 

Treat the exercise as a conversation starter that could be used to explore different software engineering concepts, such as:

* Domain Driven Design
* Testing practices
* Clean code
* Layered software design / separation of responsibilities
* Using the right data structure and/or algorithm for the right job
